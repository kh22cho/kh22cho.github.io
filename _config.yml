  Hello, I'm Kanghee Cho, a master's student in Bioinformatics at Soongsil University. I am passionate about data-driven biology, especially in the areas of single-cell transcriptomics, gene regulatory networks, and computational method development.

  I enjoy working with <mark>Python</mark>, <mark>R</mark>, and <mark>Linux</mark>-based environments. I'm experienced in handling large-scale biological datasets and have managed lab server systems for over 2 years to support collaborative research.

          This is probably one of the greatest apps ever created, if you don't agree you're probably wrong.

          I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.

            Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Compay is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.

          Founded in 1897, Soongsil University is Korea's first modern university and has played a pioneering role in the development of education, science, and technology in Korea.

          At Soongsil University, I am currently pursuing an Integrated B.S./M.S. program in Life Science and Bioinformatics. The program combines interdisciplinary training in molecular biology, computer science, and statistics, with a focus on data-driven biomedical research.

          During my undergraduate years, I served as the **vice president of the Student Council** in the Department of Chemistry, which helped me develop leadership and collaboration skills. Driven by my interest in data-driven biology, I joined a <mark>Laboratory for Single Cell Systems</mark> under the supervision of *Professor Junil Kim* [Homepage](https://sites.google.com/site/neocaleb/laboratory-for-single-cell-systems), where I contributed to projects involving scRNA-seq analysis.
          
          Currently, my master's research focuses on developing a computational tool for detecting multiplets in scRNA-seq data using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA).


  - title: A Little More About Me
    layout: text
    content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
      Outside of my academic and research work, I enjoy activities that keep me curious and balanced.

      - Jogging and Running along the riverside
      - Brewing coffee and exploring several beans  
      - Trying out new recipes and enjoying delicious food
      - Traveling and discovering new places
      
      Here's a peaceful scene I encountered during one of my trips —  
      a quiet temple deep in the forest with a gentle sign that reads  
      *그대 발길 돌리는 곳 (A place where your footsteps pause).*
      
      <p align="center">
