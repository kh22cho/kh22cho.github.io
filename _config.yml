  Hello, I'm <mark>Kanghee Cho</mark>, a master's student in the Department of Bioinformatics at Soongsil University. I am passionate about data-driven biology, especially in the areas of <strong>single-cell and spatial transcriptomics</strong>, gene regulatory networks, cancer genomics and applying machine learning to bioinformatics.

  I enjoy working with <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>R</strong>, and <strong>Linux</strong>-based environments. I am experienced in handling large-scale biological datasets and have managed lab server systems for over 2 years to support collaborative research.

          At Soongsil University, I am currently pursuing an Integrated B.S./M.S. program in Life Science and Bioinformatics. The program combines interdisciplinary training in molecular biology, computer science, and statistics, with a focus on data-driven biomedical research.

          During my undergraduate years, I served as the **Vice President of the Student Council** in the Department of Chemistry, which helped me develop leadership and collaboration skills. Driven by my interest in data-driven biology, I joined a Laboratory for Single Cell Systems under the supervision of <strong>Professor Junil Kim</strong> [[lab homepage]](https://sites.google.com/site/neocaleb/laboratory-for-single-cell-systems), where I contributed to projects involving scRNA-seq analysis.
          
          Currently, my master's research focuses on developing a computational tool for detecting multiplets in scRNA-seq data using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA).

    content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
      Outside of my academic and research work, I enjoy activities that keep me curious and balanced.

      - Jogging and Running along the riverside.
      - Brewing coffee and exploring several beans.
      - Trying out new recipes and enjoying delicious food.
      - Traveling and discovering new places.
      
      <br>Here's a peaceful scene I encountered during one of my trips — a quiet temple deep in the forest with a gentle sign that reads  
      <strong><em>그대 발길 돌리는 곳</em></strong> <em>(A place where your footsteps pause).</em>
